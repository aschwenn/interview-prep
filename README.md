These are my notes while studying data structures, algorithms, and common interview questions. I take note of benefits/drawbacks of individual data structures, types of algorithmic techniques that can be used in certain scenarios, and specific "leetcode" problems I solve, along with my solution, justification, and temporal/spatial complexities.

Most code snippets use JavaScript, which I've chosen to use for all technical interviews.

These notes are formatted such that they make sense to me and allow me to easily reference them in the future to refresh my CS fundamentals skills. I'm uploading them here in case anyone else can find them useful when studying.
